Difference b/w filter() and map(): -
------------------------------------------------
Stream s = c.stream();

c : any  collection object
stream() method is present inside Collection interface
as default method.

Stream : is an interface in java.util.stream package.

after creating Stream object there are 2 steps
1. configuration
	a. Filter mechanism
	b. Map mechanism
2. processing


1.a. Filter Mechanism: -
-----------------------
if a collection have group of number, filer only even 
number then go for Filter mechanism,Checking some 
boolean condition
-  If you want to Filter element from the collection based 
  on boolean condition, then go for filter.
- We can configure Filter by using filter() method of
  Stream interface

  public Stream filter(Predicate<T> t)
	Predicate<T> : it can be boolean valued function
	               or lambda expression.

 
1.b. Map Mechansism: -
---------------------------
if you want to done some operation each and every number
of the collection using some function then go for Map
mechanism.
- If we want to create a separate now object for every 
  object present in the collection based on some function 
  then we should go for mapping mechansim.
- We can implement mapping by using map() method of
  Stream interface.
  
  public Stream map(Function<T, R> f)
