Functional Interface
----------------------
1. It should contains exactly one abstract method.
   (SAM Single Abstract method)
2. It can caontains any number of default and static
   method (restricution application for ony abstract 
   method)
3. It acts as a type or  lambda expression
	e.g. Interf i = () -> Sopln("hello");
4. It can be used to invoke Lambda expression
	e.g. i.m1();
 



Case #1: Why Functional interface should contains only one
         abstract method?
Case #2: What is the advantage of @FuncationalInterface Annotation?
