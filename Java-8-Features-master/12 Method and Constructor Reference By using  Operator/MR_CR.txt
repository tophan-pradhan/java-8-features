Method Reference & constructor Reference By (::) Operator: -
--------------------------------------------------------------
Method reference:
------------------
If you have a Functional interface and you want to implement
the method in your class, but you have a method that have
the implementation for that abstract method you can use your
method reference that is known as method reference.

interface Interf {
   public void m1();
}

class Test {
   public static void m2() {
       System.out.println("Method Reference");
   }
   public static void main(Strign[] args){
	Interf i = Test::m2();
	i.m1();
   }
}

there are one condition refer method or refered method
having same argument type or parameter, doesn't metter 
about RT, Mod, AM, MName.

use for code reusability.
alternet of Lambda Expression


Syntax:
--------------
Static method: 
	Class Name :: Method Name
	e.g. Test::m2

Non-static method: 
	Object Reference :: Method Name
	e.g. Test t = new Test();
	     t::m2



Constructor Reference:
--------------------------------
We can use same :: operator for constructor reference
here also the argument type must same.
Syntax:
-------
     Class Name :: new
     e.g. Sample::new



We Use :: operator for MRef, CRef
