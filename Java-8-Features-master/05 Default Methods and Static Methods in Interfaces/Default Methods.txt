Default Methods: -
------------------------------
interface Inter {
     public abstrat void m1();
     public static final int x=10;
}

before 1.8 or upto 1.7 version every method is always 
public and abstract weathere we are declare or not 
inside the interface. we can't take concrete methods.


Form 1.8v we can declare concrete method in interface
these methods are known as Default method.
Declaration : 
    interfae Interf {
	defualt void m1() {
	    System.out.println("Default method");
	}    
    }
here default is keyword not Acc.Modifier

we can Override default method in sub class and if 
don't want to Override also no problem

of the method is abstrat the sub class have to write the implementation
part but in case of default method there is no need to write the
implementation.... it dependends on you... that you override or not
